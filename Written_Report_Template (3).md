### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It is important to make sure the correct fields are being selected during each step of the process to keep the results consistent.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    Campaigns that are both successful and failed are correlated
        Cancelled campaigns tend to stay consistent.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    Campaigns with higher goals are more likely to fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    We do not have insight into how many times each campaign is viewed, which would give us greater insight into if other factors effect the outcome.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    The average length of time for successful, failed or canceled campagins.
        Campagin popularity by geographic location.
